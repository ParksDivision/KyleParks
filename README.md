### Hello there! 

I'm Kyle, a Software Engineer based in Austin, Texas, with a background in Entertainment and a Bachelor's degree from UCLA. I've developed several applications in both solo and in collaborative environments and strive to deliver clean and efficient code in every aspect of my work.

My background in Film and TV allows me to operate not only with a strong creative eye, but with a seasoned attention to detail and willingness to learn. I've been lucky enough to work on some of the largest grossing films and TV shows in recent years, and I look forward to furthering my career with the knowledge I've gained.
